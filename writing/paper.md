### Introduction


In the realm of cutting-edge technology, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative force, revolutionizing various fields with its predictive capabilities and data-driven insights. From healthcare to finance, ML has made significant contributions, enabling more informed decision-making and unlocking new possibilities. One domain where ML's potential has garnered immense interest is sports outcome prediction. By leveraging vast amounts of historical data, sophisticated algorithms, and pattern recognition, ML offers the promise of enhancing our understanding of sports events and ultimately predicting their outcomes with unprecedented accuracy.

Sports, as a multi-billion-dollar industry, has not remained immune to the transformative potential of ML. The vast and ever-growing amount of data generated from sporting events, including player statistics, match results, weather conditions, and more, has become a goldmine for data scientists and sports enthusiasts alike. The application of ML in sports has not only opened new avenues for fan engagement but has also presented opportunities to gain a competitive edge for athletes, coaches, and sports organizations. These teams spend millions of dollars on algorithms used for match outcome prediction, tactical decision-making, player investments, fantasy sports, and injury prediction.[1] The picture below shows the many applications of AI and ML in sports.

At the forefront of ML applications in sports lies the captivating field of sports outcome prediction. The ability to accurately forecast the results of sporting events has fascinated researchers, data scientists, and sports analysts alike. The implications of successful outcome predictions are multifaceted – from optimizing betting strategies to providing valuable insights for fantasy sports players, and even aiding coaches in devising winning tactics based on an opponent's weaknesses.

In conclusion, the integration of machine learning in sports outcome prediction is a fascinating and dynamic field, holding immense promise for sports enthusiasts, industry stakeholders, and the wider public alike. By harnessing the power of data and advanced algorithms, we endeavour to shed light on the exciting possibilities and potential pitfalls of using ML to predict the unpredictable –outcome of sports events.


#### Research Question

How does the accuracy of Logistic Regression compare to Support Vector Machine (SVM) when used for sports outcome prediction?

#### Motivation

The significance of data-driven decision-making in the field of sports analytics is what inspired this inquiry. Football, being one of the most popular and passionately followed sports worldwide, presents a compelling arena for predictive modelling. The outcomes of football matches are influenced by a myriad of factors, ranging from team composition and player performance to weather conditions and tactical strategies. By comparing the predictive accuracy of Logistic Regression and SVM in this context, valuable insights can be gained to optimize sports outcome prediction models. Understanding which algorithm performs better in forecasting football match results can not only help sports managers and enthusiasts in making informed betting decisions but also provide teams and coaches with valuable pre-match insights to devise winning strategies. 


#### Current State of the Art

#### Goals of the Project

In this literature review, I delve into the intriguing world of using machine learning for sports outcome prediction. The aim is to explore the various methodologies and algorithms that have been employed to predict the results of sporting events. By analyzing historical data, team compositions, player performance metrics, and various contextual factors, ML models have sought to decode the intricate patterns that influence the outcome of games.

Through this research, I seek to gain a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of existing ML approaches in sports outcome prediction. Additionally, I aim to identify potential areas of improvement that could further enhance the accuracy of predictions. Furthermore, we will examine how ML-powered predictions are being utilized in real-world scenarios, such as sports betting markets and sports analytics firms, and the impact these predictions have on decision-making processes.



### Related work

[3], developed a logistic regression model to predict match results of Barclay’s premier league. What stands out is that they gathered the significant variables from various research papers rather than just making their own assumptions. They also gathered data from video games like FIFA which they said improved the quality of the data. They used variables like Home Offense,  Home Defence,  Away Offense, and Away Defence. They got a prediction accuracy of 69.5% from their model. They determined that the most significant variables were home Defence and away Defence.
