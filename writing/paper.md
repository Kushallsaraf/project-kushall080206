### Related work

[3], developed a logistic regression model to predict match results of Barclay’s premier league. What stands out is that they gathered the significant variables from various research papers rather than just making their own assumptions. They also gathered data from video games like FIFA which they said improved the quality of the data. They used variables like Home Offense,  Home Defence,  Away Offense, and Away Defence. They got a prediction accuracy of 69.5% from their model. They determined that the most significant variables were home Defence and away Defence. 

[4], used the XGBoost algorithm to predict the results using limited data. They proposed a system which uses XGBoost as their primary algorithm for sports outcome prediction. It is compared with other algorithms using a filtered dataset to find the most influential data. Optimization or normalization has been applied, and the predicted outputs will represent win, draw, or loss in human-readable form. They came to the conclusion that XGBoost could outperform many other algorithms.  

[5], set out to predict the results of the Greek league, considered the most predictable league, using 5 machine learning models. These models were as follows: k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), LogitBoost (LB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and CatBoost (CB). They engineered new features from the already existing ones. The following were created: Home Team form (the Home Team’s form according to the last five matches performance of the team), Away Team form, Home Team league points (the points the Home Team has gained in the league for the corresponding season before the match is played), Away Team league points, Home Team previous match goals (the goals scored by the Home Team in the previous match played), Away Team previous match goals, Home Team previous half time match goals (the goals scored by the Home Team in the previous match until half time) and Away Team previous half time match goals. As far as SVM is concerned they concluded they used a few parameters which resulted in an accuracy of 54.07% and the metric results were 0.4258, 0.4414 and 0.3876 for recall, precision and F1-score respectively. According to Table 3 in their paper, SVM had the least accuracy and F1-score. They also used LogitBoost which performs an additive logistic regression. It had an accuracy of 55.65% and an F1-score of 0.4962 ranking 3rd among the five models. The best-performing model was CatBoost with an accuracy of 67.73% which they applied to two more datasets. They concluded that the two most important features were Home Team Form and Away Team Form. Applying the best model to other datasets, they reached the conclusion that each league has its own properties and particularities that need to be considered separately for an accurate prediction. 

[6], modelled an algorithm using Logistic Regression, SVM and XGBoost to compare their accuracy. He used a dataset from the English Premier League. The web scraping was done and datasets from 2000 to 2015 were used. The data was split into training and testing which was then applied to 3 different classifiers and 12 features were considered. After refining the data, the model was run and the F1-score was calculated on the test data. Logistic Regression had a score of 0.6957, SVM had a score of 0.6818 and XGBoost had the highest accuracy with an F1-score of 0.7451. He further ran some tuning parameters which inflated the score to 0.7826. He concluded that adding sentiment from Twitter, and some news articles can improve the accuracy. Also including more features from various data sources could enhance the accuracy of the predictions.

[7], set out to predict the outcome of the NFL (an American football league). He used Logistic Regression and SVM models to execute the project. Scores and statistics from 2003, 2004 and 2005 were used as datasets for the models. For the first algorithm, he used his own implementation of logistic regression in Matlab, which used the Newton-Raphson method. For the second one, he used SVM-light with linear, polynomial and tangent kernels. As for the conclusion the best results were achieved by the Logistic Regression model. The results were as follows – 2005: 65.83% - 2004: 61.37% - 2003: 67.08%. They determined that using the best features with different algorithms can improve the accuracy of the predictions. 

[10], Applying knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) they developed a predictive model for football match results. By analyzing 9 crucial features influencing football outcomes, they constructed a more comprehensive system, resulting in improved prediction accuracy. To achieve this, they employed artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression (LR) techniques, utilizing Rapid Miner as our data mining tool. The implemented techniques demonstrated promising results, with the ANN technique achieving 85% prediction accuracy, and the LR technique achieving an even higher accuracy of 93%.

[11], The author developed a system with the aim of surpassing bookmakers' odds in football predictions. The goal was to identify crucial features for match prediction and calculate their probabilities to determine profitable bets. Seven machine learning algorithms, including MultiClassClassifier, RotationForest, LogitbooST, BayesNet, Naive Bayes, and Home Wins, were employed to classify matches into home wins, draws, or away wins. The achieved accuracy of his algorithm was 55%. However, the system fell short of consistently outperforming bookmakers in the long run. A significant limitation of this research was the relatively low prediction accuracy. Subsequently, the author proposed an improved system, which would consider additional features like all bookings during the match, player compositions, team managers, and more.

[12], utilizing player and team data gathered from diverse web sources, the researchers propose an expert system designed to enhance NHL game outcome predictions while also assisting in recruitment and salary decisions. The developed system integrates principal components analysis, nonparametric statistical analysis, a support vector machine (SVM), and an ensemble machine learning algorithm to forecast whether a hockey team will emerge victorious in a game. The ensemble methods exhibit enhancements over the baseline SVM classifier, with predictive accuracy for the testing set surpassing 90%. Through a comparison of various ensemble machine learning approaches, potential avenues for enhancing game outcome prediction accuracy are identified. The system streamlines the application of learning methodologies and inputs data sources for users, facilitates the evaluation of model results, and addresses inherent challenges and concerns in predicting hockey game wins.
