### Introduction


In the realm of cutting-edge technology, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative force, revolutionizing various fields with its predictive capabilities and data-driven insights. From healthcare to finance, ML has made significant contributions, enabling more informed decision-making and unlocking new possibilities. One domain where ML's potential has garnered immense interest is sports outcome prediction. By leveraging vast amounts of historical data, sophisticated algorithms, and pattern recognition, ML offers the promise of enhancing our understanding of sports events and ultimately predicting their outcomes with unprecedented accuracy.

Sports, as a multi-billion-dollar industry, has not remained immune to the transformative potential of ML. The vast and ever-growing amount of data generated from sporting events, including player statistics, match results, weather conditions, and more, has become a goldmine for data scientists and sports enthusiasts alike. The application of ML in sports has not only opened new avenues for fan engagement but has also presented opportunities to gain a competitive edge for athletes, coaches, and sports organizations. These teams spend millions of dollars on algorithms used for match outcome prediction, tactical decision-making, player investments, fantasy sports, and injury prediction.[1] The picture below shows the many applications of AI and ML in sports. 




#### Motivation

#### Current State of the Art

#### Goals of the Project

With this project i would like to compare the accuracy of 3 algorithms used in sports outcome prediction, namely Logistic Regression, Sports Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost. I have used a dataset from football of the year 2018. 

### Related work

[2], developed a logistic regression model to predict match results of Barclay’s premier league. What stands out is that they gathered the significant variables from various research papers rather than just making their own assumptions. They also gathered data from video games like FIFA which they said improved the quality of the data. They used variables like Home Offense,  Home Defence,  Away Offense, and Away Defence. They got a prediction accuracy of 69.5% from their model. They determined that the most significant variables were home Defence and away Defence. 


### Prototype

TODO: This section describes the implemented prototype - how did you implement your prototype, including the overall design of your prototype, details of the algorithms and tools if any used, etc. Use technical diagrams, equations, algorithms, and paragraphs of text to describe the research that you have completed. Be sure to number all figures and tables and to explicitly refer to them in your text.

### Experiments

TODO: This section describes your experimental set up and evaluation. It should also produce and describe the results of your study. The subsection titles below offer a typical structure used for this section.

#### Experimental Design

TODO: Especially as it pertains to responsible computing, if conducting experiments or evaluations that involve particular ethical considerations, detail those issues here.

#### Evaluation

TODO

#### Threats to Validity

TODO: What are some considerations and choices you have made during your project that might compromise some of your presented results (for example, if you are using data could there be sources of data inaccuracy, or if you are relying on an existing tool or library, a potential inaccuracy in their work might result to inaccuracy in yours).
