### Introduction


In the realm of cutting-edge technology, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative force, revolutionizing various fields with its predictive capabilities and data-driven insights. From healthcare to finance, ML has made significant contributions, enabling more informed decision-making and unlocking new possibilities. One domain where ML's potential has garnered immense interest is sports outcome prediction. By leveraging vast amounts of historical data, sophisticated algorithms, and pattern recognition, ML offers the promise of enhancing our understanding of sports events and ultimately predicting their outcomes with unprecedented accuracy.

Sports, as a multi-billion-dollar industry, has not remained immune to the transformative potential of ML. The vast and ever-growing amount of data generated from sporting events, including player statistics, match results, weather conditions, and more, has become a goldmine for data scientists and sports enthusiasts alike. The application of ML in sports has not only opened new avenues for fan engagement but has also presented opportunities to gain a competitive edge for athletes, coaches, and sports organizations. These teams spend millions of dollars on algorithms used for match outcome prediction, tactical decision-making, player investments, fantasy sports, and injury prediction.[1] The picture below shows the many applications of AI and ML in sports.

At the forefront of ML applications in sports lies the captivating field of sports outcome prediction. The ability to accurately forecast the results of sporting events has fascinated researchers, data scientists, and sports analysts alike. The implications of successful outcome predictions are multifaceted – from optimizing betting strategies to providing valuable insights for fantasy sports players, and even aiding coaches in devising winning tactics based on an opponent's weaknesses.

In conclusion, the integration of machine learning in sports outcome prediction is a fascinating and dynamic field, holding immense promise for sports enthusiasts, industry stakeholders, and the wider public alike. By harnessing the power of data and advanced algorithms, we endeavour to shed light on the exciting possibilities and potential pitfalls of using ML to predict the unpredictable –outcome of sports events.

### Related work

[3], developed a logistic regression model to predict match results of Barclay’s premier league. What stands out is that they gathered the significant variables from various research papers rather than just making their own assumptions. They also gathered data from video games like FIFA which they said improved the quality of the data. They used variables like Home Offense,  Home Defence,  Away Offense, and Away Defence. They got a prediction accuracy of 69.5% from their model. They determined that the most significant variables were home Defence and away Defence.
